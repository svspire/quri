The string "uri" is pretty dramatically overused herein.

It's both the name of a file and of a folder.
It's both the name of a struct and the name of a function.

The struct it names should actually be called a "basic-uri"
since that's how it's referred to by its own maker function.
But if we made that change, all the accessor functions would
stop working, as well as all the "sub-structs" he's making
from that root struct.

I'd kind of like to rewrite this thing using CLOS instead of 
structs. The whole thing would be a lot simpler without this
defstruct pseudo-hierarchy.

Furthermore, because he's using structs, the defstruct form
for uri implicitly creates a copy-uri function (per ANSI),
but Fukamachi is also explicitly defining a copy-uri function
in the quri file. This throws a warning on some compilers.
But the author probably never saw such a warning because he
had per-file package names, which I've removed because I find
per-file package names to be ridiculous and contrary to the spirit
of Common Lisp.

I'm going to assume that the copy-uri that's explicitly defined
is the one the author actually wants, so I'm going to tell the
defstruct to make a :copier called %copy-uri. It's possible
the author didn't know that defstruct automatically creates a copier
function and that he didn't need to define one explicitly.
